# Apache Flink Introduction

**Apache Flink** is an **open-source**, **unified stream-processing and batch-processing framework** designed for stateful computations over **unbounded** (streaming) and **bounded** (batch) data streams. Its core is a distributed streaming data-flow engine known for **high throughput**, **low latency**, and **exactly-once consistency guarantees**, even during failures. Flink provides a rich set of APIs in Java, Scala, and Python, making it a versatile tool for real-time analytics, event-driven applications, and ETL pipelines at any scale. It supports deployment on all common cluster environments, including Kubernetes and YARN.

The open-source repository for Flink is: [https://github.com/apache/flink](https://github.com/apache/flink)
