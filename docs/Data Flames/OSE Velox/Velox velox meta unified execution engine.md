Velox: Meta's Unified Execution Engine

**Velox** is Meta's high-performance, open-source C++ database acceleration library. It provides a set of reusable, extensible, and dialect-agnostic data processing components, heavily relying on **vectorization** and **adaptivity**. Velox is designed to unify execution across various data management systems, including analytical query engines (like Presto and Spark), streaming platforms, and machine learning systems. This unification improves efficiency, consistency, and developer productivity by sharing common core logic and optimizations.

The project is available on GitHub:
