# Bytewax: Python Stateful Stream Processing Framework
https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax


**Bytewax** is a Python framework and Rust-based distributed processing engine for stateful event and stream processing. Inspired by capabilities found in tools like Apache Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streams, Bytewax makes stream processing simpler and more accessible by integrating directly with the Python ecosystem you already know and trust.

**Key Features:**
- **Python-first:** Leverage your existing Python libraries, frameworks, and tooling.
- **Stateful Stream Processing:** Maintain and recover state automatically, enabling advanced online machine learning and complex event-driven applications.
- **Scalable & Distributed:** Easily scale from local development to multi-node, multi-worker deployments on Kubernetes or other infrastructures.
- **Rich Connector Ecosystem:** Ingest data from sources like Kafka, filesystems, or WebSockets, and output to data lakes, key-value stores, or other systems.
- **Flexible Dataflow API:** Compose pipelines using operators (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `join`, `fold_window`) to express complex logic.
