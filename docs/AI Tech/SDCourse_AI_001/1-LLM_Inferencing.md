# LLM Inferencing

## LLM Architecture

Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks designed to understand and generate human language. They typically use transformer architectures, which rely on attention mechanisms to process input text efficiently and capture long-range dependencies.

### Key Components of LLM Architecture

- **Embedding Layer:** Converts input tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Positional Encoding:** Adds information about token positions to the embeddings.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
- **Feedforward Layers:** Process the outputs of the attention mechanism for deeper representation.
- **Layer Normalization:** Stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing activations.
- **Output Layer:** Maps processed representations back to the vocabulary for prediction.
