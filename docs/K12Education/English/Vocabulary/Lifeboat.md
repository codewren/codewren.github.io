Lifeboat Option

Please provide a single sentence describing a new method for optimizing computing task latency, given that: (1) its improvement is marginal, so we're deferring its implementation; (2) we're prioritizing the search for superior methods; and (3) we will use this method as a 'lifeboat' only if all other options fail.

Answer 1:

We'll hold this latency optimization method, which offers only a **marginal improvement**, in reserve as a **"lifeboat" option**, exploring more impactful alternatives first and resorting to it only if no other viable solutions are found.

Details:

**The "lifeboat" option** is a **last-resort method or solution** offering a modest but guaranteed benefit when primary or superior alternatives have failed.

**Marginal improvement** refers to a **small, incremental, or minimal enhancement** in performance, efficiency, or quality achieved by an adjustment.
